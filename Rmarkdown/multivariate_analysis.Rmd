# Create unique ID for clustered effects
  data_long_final$trial <- with(data_long_final, interaction(Experiment.code, diff))
  
# Now, let's check that this data is set up correctly. If we group by Experiment.code, diff and outcome then we should have a maximum of 1 effect size for each study/diff in each outcome category
  check <- data_long_final %>% group_by(trial, outcome) %>% summarise(n=n()) %>% filter(n !=1)

# OUTCOME: There still appear to be columns(~40) with more than 1 effect size for each longevity/reproduction effect size. This is also not because we could have males and female effect sizes as including sex does not resolve this problem
  
# The Experiment code identifiers that are relevant are:
  unique(check$trial)

# VCV matrix. Let's set up the multivariate meta-analysis model. We first need to create the VCV sampling matrix. This is a block diagonal matrix with the sampling variance for each effect size on the diagonal and the sampling covariance between the two effect sizes on the off-diagonal. We don't know the correlation, but we can assume 0.5. 
  
  V <- vcalc(vi=data_long_final$v, cluster =  data_long_final$trial, rho = 0.5)

# Multivariate model. Using the VCV matrix we can set up the model. We'll keep it simple for now
